# Wateragri Geodatabase

WATERAGRI is a new H2020 research & innovation project that aims to re-introduce and enhance sustainable solutions for water retention and nutrient recycling to enable agricultural production that can sustain growing populations and cope with present and future climate change challenges.

The geo-database for WATERAGRI is a tool to collect and organize data coming from the project case study. The system has to manage data from disperse and heterogeneous sources.
